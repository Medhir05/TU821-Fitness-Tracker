 This program allows a user to update a fitness tracker with their workout for each day of the week. The user can login, create an account or continue as a guest. The user can then select how many exercises per day, the name of the exercise, and how many sets and reps per exercise. Your overall workout will then be returned to you in the terminal and saved to a file. Additionally, the user can add extra types of exercise they did in the day, and log information such as calories burned and time spent exercising. This additional information is stored in a seperate file.
